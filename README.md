# iOS-Developer-Challenge

`version 1.6`

Thanks! for Selection Me for this challange. 


## Project Structure

Project is built on last Xcode 6.3 version, with last iOS and tested on iphone 6 Plus. 

 - Project is using Cocoa-Pods for third party libraries, controllers or helper classes (https://cocoapods.org/)
 - Licence files are included in each cocoa-pod project (dependent on git repo)
 - For local storage I used realm db for swift (https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/)
 - For internet, WS communication, I used Alamofire (https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
 - For JSON parsing, I have used SwiftyJson (https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)
 - For Network Prgoress indicator, I have used SVProgressHUD (https://github.com/TransitApp/SVProgressHUD)
 - To provide Blur effect I have used AFBlurSegue (https://github.com/AlvaroFranco/AFBlurSegue)
 - Keyboard management in Form controller (add food Data) I used TPKeyboardAvoiding (https://github.com/michaeltyson/TPKeyboardAvoiding)

## TODO

This app has quite big potential,and I'm only able to touch some of points, so there are couple of other points what I would add in future of its development:

 - Add other data from websites using Kamino API
 - Use Graphics Buttons instead of simple one.
 - Add parallex effect on views.
 - Ability to delete/edit data.
 - Ability add Custom nutrion facts
